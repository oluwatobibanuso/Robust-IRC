Robust Integral Resonant Control (IRC) for High Precision Nanopositioning Systems


Nanopositioning is a key enabling technology in a number of applications such as Scanning Probe Microscopy, nanomachining, nanolithography, MEMS / NEMS etc. Most nanopositioners employ piezoelectric actuators and as such their positioning performance is limited by: (i) Resonance-induced vibration and (ii) Nonlinearities:
Hysteresis and Creep. 

The popular method employed to overcome these limitations is to implement a closed-loop control strategy with suitable damping and tracking controllers, to ultimately deliver accurate positioning over a desired bandwidth. This project gives the state-of-the-art in Nanopositioning as well as the control theory associated with it. After a critical analysis of existing control options, the Integral Resonant Control strategy was chosen as optimal solution be made. I designed an Integral Resonant Controller (IRC) for reducing positioning errors and dampening dominant resonant harmonics in nanopositioning systems typically caused by vibrations and hysteresis. The IRC damping controller and a suitable tracking controller was designed and the performance improvement between open and closed-loop actuation will be simulated and analyzed. A measure of positioning bandwidth, positioning error, input and output disturbance rejection as well as robustness to changes in system resonance will be essential to the final analysis.
